1. add type hints - better ide linting / completion, better for collaboration with other devs, less error-prone
2. extract constants to top of file, don't need to change every occurence, e.g. path for dataset, threshold for number of reviews
3. don't hardcore inputs, make the user choose and calculate based on that - correlation based on lotr part1
4. rewriting same variable with different types, first df then list
5. error_bad_lines arg of read_csv doesn't exist -> different version? changed to on_bad_lines='skip'
6. inconsistent ' / "
7. error in tab agg -> non numeric field


LoR -> LotR # STANDARD NAMING !!!

good stuff: expressive naming, nice comments, flat tree - not too many nests, 

###########################

design:
extract -> request for datasets at kaggle, retry if failed
transform -> cleanup, empty values, duplicates, dtypes

analysis - shape, head, corr_matrix
    - year as int, rating as int

encoding as cp1251 - mine looks as utf
parametrize number of recommendations?

future 
    - multiple books/authors on input?
    - maybe store the correlation matrix somewhere? cache results?
    - pickle dataset? faster startup, flag on new data
    - api behind oauth
    - retry on download
    - rate limiting
